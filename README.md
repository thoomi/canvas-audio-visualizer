# Canvas Audio Visualizer
This is just a simple and quick try out of the Web Audio API. 
It takes either an audio file or the microphone input to visualizer the data on a canvas element.

### Develop
In order to develop or to try out a local copy of this make sure to install all dependencies by running:

    npm install

I used BrowserSync during development, so just run

    grunt serve
and your default browser pops up and the source files will be live reloaded in the browser.
